# JavaScript Array Method Refresh

This repository is my space for revisiting JavaScript array methods — not because I’m seeing them for the first time, but because I believe fundamentals deserve regular attention.

# Why I’m Doing This

I’ve worked with methods like map, filter, find, and more in past projects. But I’m using this as an opportunity to:

Spot any gaps in my understanding

Strengthen my mental models for when and why to use each method

Share my key takeaways in simple, clear language

This is not a crash course or a formal tutorial — it’s a personal learning journal that I’m sharing publicly.

# How It Works

Daily Commit → I explore 5–6 array methods each day

Notes.md → Contains my plain-language explanations, use cases, and key takeaways

Code Examples → Short, focused code snippets to show the method in action

LinkedIn Post → A short daily reflection to document progress

# Invitation

If you notice something I can improve, or a better way to use a method — I’d love to hear from you. This is about growth, not perfection.
