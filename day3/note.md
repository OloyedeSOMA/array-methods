## Day 3 – JavaScript Array Methods
Methods Covered

push()

unshift()

pop()

shift()

splice()

## Plain-Language Explanations

push() – Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.

unshift() – Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length.

pop() – Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

shift() – Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.

splice() – A powerful method that can add, remove, or replace elements at specific positions in an array. It modifies the original array.

## When to Use Them (Use Cases)

push() → When you want to add new data at the end of a list.
Example: Adding a new message to the end of a chat history.

unshift() → When you need to add data to the start of a list.
Example: Adding a new notification at the top of a notifications list.

pop() → When you need to remove the most recent item.
Example: Removing the latest action from an undo stack in a text editor.

shift() → When you need to remove the oldest item.
Example: Removing the earliest song from a playlist queue after it finishes playing.

splice() → When you need fine-grained control (insert, delete, replace) at specific positions.
Example: Removing a canceled order from the middle of a list, or inserting an ad into the 3rd position of a feed.

## Key Takeaways

This group is about adding/removing elements, unlike yesterday’s methods (which were about finding, checking, and validating data).
